Callback Assignment: Summer Chores\
Created a "Callback Hell" to simulate summer chores.

Summer Chores using Promises\
Created the same program simulating chores, but updating it to use Promises.

Summer Chores with Async and Await\
Using the updated chores program we had to update it to use Async and Await instead of chaining promises

Also found a typo in the code for Promises. It worked when it was run, but I had missed remvoing a callback paramter in the first chore. Found it when I tried to run the async version.
